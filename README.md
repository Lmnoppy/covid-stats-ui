# octo-broccoli-react-ui
Currently learning front end devleopment so decided to build a simple user management ui. That means this its not secure code in anyways shape or form, please only use this as i have, a learning opertunity. 

The back end is powered by either octo-broccoli Java or Express Firebase functions (i wanted to learen firebase functions) so the Java version isnt actually working well as it has no user auth currently.
